Starting on April 15th, 2024 and running through Earth Day (April 22nd) we will be running an earth observation hackathon. This is sponsored by Earth Daily Analytics and the Pacific Coastal Computing Association, with the generous involvement of the First Nations Emergency Services Society.

In this repo, you will find some example notebooks to help you get started with understanding how to process satellite imagery.

Please make sure that you are signed up for the hackathon at https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeCIQI7zi_0XPPR2O3JswMdeEVgfOAiB9DAZJ9hfAEEaPybOw/viewform

And let us know at hackathon@coastalcomputing.ca if you have any questions or comments!
