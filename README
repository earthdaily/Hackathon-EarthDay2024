Starting on April 15th, 2024 and running through Earth Day (April 22nd) we will be running an earth observation hackathon. This is sponsored by Earth Daily Analytics and the Pacific Coastal Computing Association, with the generous involvement of the First Nations Emergency Services Society (FNESS)

We are preparing for another difficult wildfire season per this news report: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-W_CNim5_E

And we are trying to figure out how to help provide information layers to the FNESS lightship tool: https://fness.lightship.works/v2/public/workspace/90443a23-f822-4ce0-8e2d-c0af1b28ea17/map

In this repo, you will find some example notebooks to help you get started with understanding how to process satellite imagery.

Here is a video walkthrough of how to use one of the notebooks: https://vimeo.com/933471203/ddba3fb127?share=copy
